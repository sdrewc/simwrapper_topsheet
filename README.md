# Simwrapper Dashboard and Summary File Configuration for Topsheet Generation

## Overview
This section outlines how to configure and run scripts necessary for generating topsheets using the Simwrapper dashboard.


## Setting Up Your Environment

To streamline the setup process and reduce the need for manual configuration and file transfers, you should directly download the entire GitHub repository for each model run. Hereâ€™s how to proceed if you're setting up a dashboard within the directory `X:\Projects\CHAMP7\Run25w_Market`:

1. **Create a New Folder**:
   - Create a folder named "topsheet" and download the GitHub repository into this folder.

2. **Modify Configuration Files**:
   - In the `topsheet.ctl` file, set the following:
     - `WORKING_FOLDER` to `X:\Projects\CHAMP7\Run25w_Market`. I strongly recommend using an absolute path for accuracy and consistency.
     - `OUTPUT_FOLDER` to `X:\Projects\CHAMP7\Run25w_Market\topsheet\data`. Again, using an absolute path is highly recommended for best results.

3. **Execution**:
   - Execute `topsheet_run.bat` as an administrator to view the dashboard.
