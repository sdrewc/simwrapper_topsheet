# Simwrapper Dashboard and Summary File Configuration for Topsheet Generation

## Overview
This section outlines how to configure and run scripts necessary for generating topsheets using the Simwrapper dashboard.

## Setting Up Your Environment
1. **Configure Paths**:
   - **WORKING_FOLDER**: This directory must contain all the input files required by the six scripts for topsheet generation. The required files are listed in the `topsheet.ctl` file. You typically do not need to alter this file.
   - **OUTPUT_FOLDER**: Set this to the directory where the topsheet outputs should be saved.
   
2. **Execution**:
   - Double-click `topsheet_run.bat` to initiate the topsheet creation process.
